<p>Over the years, I have made various experiments trying to see how much of a web presence I could create without spending any money. The domain name is provided at no cost by <a href="https://nic.eu.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EU.org</a>. In all the years that I have been tinkering on the internet, <a href="https://nic.eu.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EU.org</a> is the only reliable source of free domain names. DNS hosting is provided by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a>.</p>
