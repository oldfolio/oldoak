<p>Over the years, I have made various experiments trying to see how much of an internet presence I could create without spending any money. This web site is part of my latest experiment. The domain name is provided at no cost by <a href="https://nic.eu.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EU.org</a>. In all the years that I have been tinkering on the internet, <a href="https://nic.eu.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EU.org</a> is the only reliable source of free domain names. The web site itself is hosted at no cost on <a href="https://github.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. DNS hosting is provided by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a>. Another viable, no-cost DNS host is <a href="https://dns.he.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hurricane Electric</a>. For my purposes, the advantage of CloudFlare over Hurricane Electric is CloudFlare's no-cost email forwarding service, which I have used for this domain's email in the past.</p>
